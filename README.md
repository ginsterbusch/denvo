DEveloper ENvironment Info
==========================

Extremely light-weight, simple environment information for developers, including data like PHP version, WP Version, memory_limit, MySQL version and so on.
Got on my balls that there was nothing really light-weight doing the job. Drop it, take a quick look, tadaa!

## Suggested plugins

Other plugins that might help you out quickly as well:

- Adminer - GREAT tool for quickly running a few SQL queries, and when phpMyAdmin is just too overkill ;) - https://wordpress.org/plugins/adminer/
- wpOptionsAdmin - Access to ALL options with a nifty interface, etc.
- MiwoFTP - Solid file manager, which also allows zipped downloads and uploads - https://wordpress.org/plugins/miwoftp/
